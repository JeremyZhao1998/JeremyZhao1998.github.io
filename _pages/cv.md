{% include base_path %}

I expect to obtain my master's degree in July 2025, currently in the job-seeking stage, looking for internship positions with potential to full-time employment.

I am interested in positions related to 2D/3D computer vision, VLMs, LLMs, or model lightweighting.

If you find that my experiences align with the positions available at your company, please feel free to email me at **zhaozijing1998@qq.com**, and I will promptly reply with my updated resume.
