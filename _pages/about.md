****

Postgraduate student of [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) (PKU). 

I entered [Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies](http://www.aais.pku.edu.cn/) (AAIS), PKU in June 2022 for a master's degree of Data Science (Computer Science and Technology), supervised by [Prof. Yang Liu](http://www.csyangliu.com/) at [Wangxuan Institite of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/) (WICT), PKU. 
I'm also a member of [Multimedia Information Processing Lab](http://59.108.48.34/tiki/pengyuxin/) (MIPL), led by [Prof. Yuxin Peng](http://59.108.48.34/tiki/yuxinpeng/).

I received B.Eng. in [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/) (SCSE), [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/) (also known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, BUAA).

My research interests include computer vision, vision-language models, machine learning and their lightweight applications in practical scenarios.

## Working/Internship Experiences

**Algorithm Engineering Intern, Technology and Engineering Group (TEG), [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/)**  
Feb 2022 - Aug 2022    Beijing, China  
I built an end-to-end acceleration toolkit based on [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and [CUBLAS](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas) for the inference of Transformer models. It includes a high performance tokenizer and a dynamic FP16/INT8 mixed quantization with configurable accuracy and inference speed.

**Research Intern, Business Intelligence Lab, [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/)**  
Mar 2021 - Sep 2021    Beijing, China  
I built [PaddleFSL](https://github.com/tata1661/FSL-Mate/tree/master/PaddleFSL): A Python library for few-shot learning (FSL) based on [PaddlePaddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/). I also participated in projects on Graph Nerual Networks and Molecular Property Prediction tasks.
