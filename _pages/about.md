Researcher at [Lenovo Research](https://research.lenovo.com/webapp/view_English/index.html).  

I joined Intelligent Computing Infrastructure Laboratory (ICI Lab) lead by [Dr. Weifeng Zhang](https://research.lenovo.com/webapp/view_English/personal.html?id=541) of [Lenovo Research](https://research.lenovo.com/webapp/view_English/index.html) in July 2025.  

I received my master's degree of Data Science (Computer Science and Technology) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) (PKU), Beijing, China in July 2025.
I studied in [Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies](http://www.aais.pku.edu.cn/) (AAIS), PKU, supervised by Assistant Prof. [Yang Liu](http://www.csyangliu.com/) at [Wangxuan Institite of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/) (WICT), PKU, from September 2022 to July 2025.    

I obtained my bachelor's degree of Computer Science and Techonology in [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/) (SCSE), [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/) (also known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, BUAA) in July 2021.  

My research now focus on **Privacy Enhanced Computing** and **Model Generalization** in **Computer Vision** and **Multimodal Learning** scenarios.
