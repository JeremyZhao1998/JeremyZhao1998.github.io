****

Postgraduate student of [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) (PKU). 

I entered [Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies](http://www.aais.pku.edu.cn/) (AAIS), PKU in September 2022 for a master's degree of Data Science (Computer Science and Technology), supervised by Assistant Prof. [Yang Liu](http://www.csyangliu.com/) at [Wangxuan Institite of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/) (WICT), PKU. 
I'm also a member of [Multimedia Information Processing Lab](http://59.108.48.34/tiki/pengyuxin/) (MIPL), led by Prof. [Yuxin Peng](http://59.108.48.34/tiki/yuxinpeng/).

I obtained B.Eng. degree in [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/) (SCSE), [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/) (also known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, BUAA) in July 2021.

My research interests include **Computer Vision**, **Vision-Language Multimodal Learning** and **Lightweight Models** in practical scenarios.
