****

Postgraduate student of [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) (PKU). 

I entered [Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies](http://www.aais.pku.edu.cn/) (AAIS), PKU in June 2022 for a master's degree of Data Science (Computer Science and Technology), supervised by [Prof. Yang Liu](http://www.csyangliu.com/) at [Wangxuan Institite of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/) (WICT), PKU. 
I'm also a member of [Multimedia Information Processing Lab](http://59.108.48.34/tiki/pengyuxin/) (MIPL), led by [Prof. Yuxin Peng](http://59.108.48.34/tiki/yuxinpeng/).

I received B.Eng. in [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/) (SCSE), [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/) (also known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, BUAA).

My research interests include computer vision, multi-modal learning and their lightweight applications in practical scenarios.
